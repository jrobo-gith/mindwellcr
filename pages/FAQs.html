            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What is Person-Centred Counselling?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">Person-Centred Counselling is completely focused on you, the client. It is a non-judgemental, confidential approach that allows you to set the agenda and pace of your own therapy. You are then able to develop a greater understanding of yourself, build confidence, self esteem and resilience to deal with the issues you are facing every day. Each session will be an opportunity for you talk about whatever you need to discuss at that moment in time. The counsellor will metaphorically walk alongside you to support you in whatever way you need at that time to enable you to sort through your overwhelming thoughts and feelings and to find answers to whatever you need to.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">Who can benefit from counselling?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">Anyone and everyone can benefit from counselling. People look for help for a wide variety of issues. Including, but not limited to:<br>Depression, anxiety, low mood, stress, confidence and self esteem issues, abuse, relationship difficulties, big life events or changes, grief or loss, anger, childhood issues, attachment issues, trauma, addiction, phobias, bullying, or anything that you feel is holding you back or affecting your life in a negative way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What to expect in the first counselling session</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">The first session, after the initial consultation, is an opportunity for us to get to know each other to see if we can build a professional therapeutic relationship. I will be able to explain more about the sessions and how they will work as well as find out what has brought you to therapy, what your expectations are of me and the process of therapy. You will then have an opportunity to talk about what has brought you to counselling or whatever you need to talk about at that time. At the end of the session we can decide if we feel we would work well together and we can arrange the next appointment if you wish to do so.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What if I need to rearrange or cancel a session?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">If you are unable to attend a session, please let me know as soon as you can so we can rearrange at a better time for you. The required notice for cancellations or rearrangements is at least 24 hours. Cancellations or rearrangements with less than 24 hours notice are charged at the full rate. Wherever possible I will try and rearrange to a time or date better suited to you. If you do not attend your session and don’t inform me you will be charged the full session rate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">How long does each session last?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">Each therapeutic session will last 50 minutes. This does not include the initial consultation, if required, which will last for 10 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">How regularly will I see my counsellor?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">I offer weekly or fortnightly sessions depending on what you would like to do. However, I recommend weekly sessions initially just to support building the therapeutic relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">How long does therapy normally last?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">This varies enormously depending on you and what you would like to achieve. What is important is that it is up to you to decide how long you would like for us to work together and you don't need to commit to a specific number of sessions. As a guide I would recommend 8 - 10 sessions are probably a good start to allow that effective change you are looking for to build. However, there is no limit to the amount of sessions you can have if you want to continue with that support and guidance for your well being.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">Can I change from online to face-to-face or vice versa if I want to?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">Yes, if your circumstances change throughout the process you can change to online or face-to-face or telephone sessions. There will be changes to the contract that we will agree for the different mediums to ensure we are working ethically and safely and that you are comfortable with the process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What information do <u>I</u> need before I start counselling?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">Before we start the counselling sessions you will receive a copy of the contract we will work within which details the important aspects of the therapeutic relationship. Click <a href="/partials/images/counselling-contract-mindwell.pdf" download>here</a> to download a copy of the contract.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What information do <u>you</u> need before I start counselling?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">I will ask you a few questions to give me a brief overview of why you are thinking of having counselling. This so I can make sure I am the right person to support you in the right way. I will have a consultation with you about any previous counselling you may have had and how that was for you, or if you haven't had counselling before I can explain a bit more about it so you know what to expect. I will also talk to you about what you would like to get out of the counselling process so I can support you in the way you want to be supported. If the sessions go ahead following the initial 10 minute conversion I will need some information from you to check your availability & so I can ensure you are safe whilst working with me. Click <a href="/partials/images/client-assessment-form.pdf" download>here</a> to see the client information form.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">I have more questions.</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">That’s fine. You can have a look through my website to see if your questions are answered there or we can have a free no obligation 10 minute consultation by phone or online for you to ask any questions you would like to ask before deciding if you want to proceed. </p>
