                <h2 class="benefit-title">Clarity</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img class="show-picture" src="/partials/images/Clarity.jpg" loading="eager" alt="A magnifying glass, symbolising clarity in thoughts, feelings and behaviours. ">
                    <p class="hide-text">Individual counselling can help you to uncover and understand the origins of negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Sometimes they are the result of unresolved issues or trauma from your past. These lingering problems can make it hard to find clarity in the present. Identifying those thoughts and feelings and seeing them clearly for what they are will mean that you can move forward and change your perspective on everything that is pulling you down.</p>

                <h2 class="benefit-title">Self-Awareness</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img class="show-picture" src="/partials/images/SelfAwareness.png" loading="eager" alt="A jigsaw piece fitting into a head, symbolising self-awareness">
                    <p class="hide-text">Counselling can help you develop self-awareness by exploring your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This can help you identify patterns and areas for improvement. Self-awareness can tell us a lot about how we’re feeling and our behaviours in certain situations. Without self-awareness comes a lack of understanding of our emotions, which leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms or avoidance of certain, everyday scenarios. Avoidance can also lead to an increase in anxiety and stress, and may also result in a lack of understanding of those around us and a sense of disconnection in relationships.</p>

                    <p class="hide-text">The therapeutic process is designed to empower you and promote your autonomy. Instead of giving direct advice, counselling aims to help clients explore their thoughts, feelings, behaviours and options, enabling them to make informed decisions on their own, removing anxiety and improving self-esteem.</p>

                    <p class="hide-text">Counselling will give you time to talk, to identify what changes you need to make in your life and they will support you in making those changes once they have been identified. Sometimes our minds are overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings so we can’t think straight or see what changes we need to make to improve our mental wellbeing. A counsellor will help you to sort through those feelings, identify potential roadblocks and strategies to overcome them and ultimately help you to understand yourself better which will lead to making positive changes in your life.</p>

                    <img class="show-picture" src="/partials/images/self-belief.png" loading="lazy" alt="A man jumping from one cliff to another, symbolising self-belief.">
                    <p class="hide-text">People who have low self-esteem can really benefit from counselling. A counsellor can help you recognise and reduce negative self-talk which will have a huge impact on self-esteem. People can also build compassion for themselves and set goals for what they want to achieve, both of which are linked to improved self-esteem. The counsellor will help you: 
                        Challenge negative thoughts and encourage you to reframe those negative thoughts.
                        Teach you to replace any self critical thoughts with positive and compassionate statements.
                        Help you recognise your strengths and accomplishments and how to care for yourself.
                        Put boundaries in place that can allow you to make better choices</p>

                <h2 class="benefit-title">Resilience</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img class="show-picture" src="/partials/images/resilience.png" loading="lazy" alt="A plant growing in a cracked and dry area, symbolising resiliance.">
                    <p class="hide-text"> Knowing and understanding what is behind or underneath our individual “triggers” means our emotional responses are easier to manage and contain. When we know how something affects our emotions we are better prepared to face everyday challenges and our own thoughts and feelings. This is one way counselling can help you build emotional resilience. As you become better at returning from adversity, you will build resilience and be more ready for future life events.</p>
