            <p>This is a type of therapy that is tailored to suit individual clients and how they like to work in order to express their feelings and experiences. It could help people who have difficulty putting their thoughts and feelings into words but can be relaxing for anyone to try. If you decide that it is not working for you, that is fine, we can try something new or just talk. We can use it at the beginning of the session to settle you or throughout the whole session depending on how you want to work. It is entirely within your control.</p>
            <p><br>It can help to work through difficult emotions, make sense of events, understand yourself better and find new ways to look at issues that are troubling you. Sometimes working in a creative way allows deeper thoughts and feelings to emerge more naturally.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>We could use techniques like mindful colouring, clay work, sand tray, creative Jenga, question cards or drawing. You donâ€™t have to be good at art to benefit from creative therapy it is about the process of creating something and not the finished article.</p>
            <p><br>Doing a creative activity with a counsellor can help put you at ease. It can be an effective way to communicate because you are distracted by the actions involved in the activity and feel less pressured to focus on uncomfortable issues.</p>
