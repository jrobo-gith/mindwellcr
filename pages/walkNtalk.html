                <p class="paragraph">Walk and talk therapy, also known as outdoor therapy, is a concept that can be best described as taking traditional counselling sessions outdoors.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">For walk and talk therapy I work in a variety of outdoor settings, using local footpaths, or walking around urban environments, whatever suits you best. All routes will be risk assessed before the session to ensure your safety on the route.</p>

        <h3><u>Benefits of Walk & Talk Therapy</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Walk and talk therapy can be an especially helpful method of working for people who don't have the opportunity to get out into nature very often and for those who feel as if they thrive better when they do. Having therapeutic conversations outdoors, either while walking, sitting, or a mixture of both, can add a totally different and positive dynamic to the experience. </p>
        <ul class="wt-benefits">
            <li>Outdoor counselling is good for those who may feel a little anxious or claustrophobic in the environment of a one-on-one session in a room -  the potential intensity of eye contact is removed for those who find it an uncomfortable part of therapeutic work.</li>
            <li>When we move our bodies and shift our environment, we can think differently about aspects of our lives that have before seemed immovable. Being outdoors is a physically more relaxing experience for our bodies and, therefore, our minds may be freer to open up.</li>
            <li>Working therapeutically outdoors can help with feelings of being “stuck”, as we are moving forwards in the sessions physically. </li>
            <li>Being outside releases endorphins and is generally mood-enhancing, can support weight loss, lowers blood pressure, boosts immunity, speeds up digestion, and improves heart health.</li>
            <li>Walking together side by side also means a sense of equality and union in the partnership between client and counsellor.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="questions-container">
            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What about the weather?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">I am happy to walk in any weather but if you would prefer to work inside if it is raining we can arrange that on a week by week basis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What about confidentiality?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">The routes chosen are usually quiet but if someone does walk past we will pause the conversation and only continue when you are happy to do so.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h2 class="question-title">What if I am not very fit?</h2>
                <p class="question-content hide-text">You will set the pace so we can walk as quickly or as slowly as you are comfortable with. We can also pause at a bench or somewhere appropriate to stop or you can continue walking at a slower pace. It is totally up to you as the client.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3><u>What to expect from sessions</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">We will meet at the same time and place each week and begin walking as soon as you are happy to do so. We can walk the same route each week or vary it, depending on how you feel. We can agree where you would like to walk next time at the end of every session. We will walk in any weather as long as you are happy to do so, so make sure you wear appropriate clothing for the conditions and sturdy shoes. You may also need a bottle of water and a sunhat if the day is warm. Please also bring your inhalers if you are asthmatic.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">During the session we will walk at a gentle pace whilst speaking about whatever is important to you. You can choose to sit down or rest at any point and I will be able to suggest suitable stopping places.</p>
