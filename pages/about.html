        <div class="text training-text">
            <p>My personal experiences and training have given me a broad understanding of life and emotions which has led me to a non-judgmental down-to-earth approach. My areas of professional expertise include depression, anxiety, stress, relationships, self-esteem, parent and child relationships, self harming, loss and trauma. I believe in personal growth and I want to empower my clients to gain knowledge, self awareness and self-confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text experience-text">
            <p>I gained experience in an agency that was passionate about removing shame from the therapy process and enabling people to feel confident in asking for help when it is needed but also building resilience to help themselves build strategies for the future. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text young-people-text">
            <p>I have also worked with young people in a pastoral role for many years so I can see the challenges of being a teenager in a world that feels as though it is shifting underneath you.<br>My clients are of all genders presenting with an array of different diagnoses and life issues including those who want to maintain a sense of wellbeing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text member-text">
            <p>I'm a member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy) ethical body. I follow their ethical framework to ensure clients are treated professionally and ethically which includes regular supervision and regular training and keeps us both safe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text as-a-counsellor-text">
            <p>As a counsellor I feel ongoing training is not just a requirement of being a member of the BACP, I also feel it is necessary to be able to offer the best I can to my clients. Because of this, I actively engage in continual CPD (continuing professional development) in a variety of ways so I can support my clients better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>I understand that meeting someone new can be difficult and you might not know what to expect especially if you have not had counselling before. I offer an initial consultation for 10 minutes either on the telephone or in an online meeting. This is an ideal time for you to ask me any questions that you might have, see if you feel comfortable with me, and also to go over how we can work together. Maybe think of it as a ‘getting to know you’ session.</p>
